Before using Qt designer you must set the PYQTDESIGNERPATH enviroment variable to current path.
$ PYQTDESIGNERPATH = .:PYQTDESIGNERPATH"
$ export PYQTDESIGNERPATH
$ designer-qt4

Otherwise you won't be able to insert new TweetView widgets. However, you'll still be able to use the added widget, I think.

After editing the at ui files, the ui_ files must be regenerated using the ./build.py script.
